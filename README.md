# Fuel-Economy-Prediction

**Overview:**   
The project focuses on predicting vehicle fuel efficiency (mpg) using linear regression in Python. 
The analysis leverages libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels to develop and evaluate a model based on features like cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and car name. 
The process involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature selection, and model evaluation, addressing challenges such as missing values and inconsistent data formats.
The objective is to build an accurate model and identify key factors influencing fuel efficiency.
